1. dispatch user variable, i took it as a variable so dont need to write user.user or something else, only 
dispatch(userDetails(user))
thats it

2. in store.js -
 userSlice is an OBJECT so NO {} BRACKETS
import userSlice from './slices/userSlice'

3. in main.jsx - 
this store is our main store we created, so it will be in {} brackets  but other store is a property from react
import { store } from './components/store.js'
